# Minimalist Digital Clock

A clean, minimalist digital clock with subtle animations, time-based themes, and location-based weather display.

## Features

- Real-time clock with hours, minutes, and seconds
- Current date display with highlighted day of the week
- Time-based greetings (Good Morning, Good Afternoon, etc.)
- Time-based theme changes (different themes for morning, afternoon, evening, and night)
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Location-based weather information display with temperature in Celsius
- Clean, minimalist design
- Fully responsive design

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Allow location access when prompted to get local weather information.
3. The clock will display the current time, date and weather for your location.
4. The theme will automatically change based on the time of day.
5. Click the moon/sun icon in the top right to toggle between light and dark themes.
6. The current day of the week is highlighted automatically.

## Weather Integration

The project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display real-time weather data based on your current location. If location access is denied, it will default to Manila, Philippines.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with minimalist styling)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts (Montserrat for the clock, Poppins for other text)
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- Geolocation API for user location

## Customization

You can customize the clock by modifying the CSS variables in the `:root` selector in `styles.css`. Change colors, transition speeds, and more to match your preferences.
